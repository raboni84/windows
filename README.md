# WARNING

Some of the scripts in this project **will** destroy all data on the selected disk. So be careful! **I will not take any responsibility for any of your lost files!**

# DISCLAIMER

As I will just ignorantly enforce my security standards upon you browsing through this repository, you have to think on your own before blindly installing any kind of software or simply trust any scripts and programs. Look into the scripts yourself. Will they fit your needs? Do they have some undesired dependencies? You have to understand yourself what they do! I for myself only fully trust software that I either have

  - written myself, or
  - understood the source code by analyzing it myself.

Everything else needs to be used by many people in the wild to gain some level of trust or has to be of a known good source, from which the latter **I am not to you**. So please be careful.

That's all for now. Have fun with it. --raboni84
